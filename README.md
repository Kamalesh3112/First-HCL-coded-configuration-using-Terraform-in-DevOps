# Basic configuration file using HCL in Terraform from DevOps
- This repository mainly consist of the first Hashicorp Configuration Language that I created using the infrastructure provisioning tool such as Terraform. It is a infrastructure provisioning tool used in DevOps for to represent the configuration files in human readable form called as HCL.  Here, I just defined the resources and variables using the functions available in Terraform under (.tf) file extension format. I mainly used terraform to declare the resources which represents infrastructure objects in the configuration file.

## Technologies and techniques used in this configuration
- Terraform
- HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Microsoft windows command prompt

### Notes regarding learning resources:
- The learning materials for DevOps and Terraform is available in this repository.
- Basic configuration files are available.
